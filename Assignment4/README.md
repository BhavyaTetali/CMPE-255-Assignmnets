# Clustering techniques

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning approach that includes clustering data points.
We may use a clustering method to categorize each data point in a specific group given a set of data points.

Below the clustering techniques implemented in this colab:

* K-means
* Hierarchical clustering
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* DBscan clustering

## Dataset

The dataset utilized is iris dataset from scikit-learn. The dataset has 150 rows and 4 columns, namely: Sepal Length, Sepal width, Petal Length, Petal Width.

## PyCaret

To implement Dbscan clustering, PyCaret is used.
It is a state-of-art machine learning module that allows you perform various ML algorithms with less code. 
Simple methods like create_model, assign_model(), plot_model() would help you perform DB Scan clustering in a few lines of code.
